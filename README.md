# Bookinger Project

Welcome to the Bookinger project! This is a Django-based backend application specifically designed for booking time slots at a barbershop. The project is neatly organized into several directories, each serving a unique purpose in the application.

In the near future, we're planning to add a React Native client in the `client` directory and a React frontend in the `frontend` directory. Here's a quick rundown of the current project structure:

- `backend`: This is the heart of the project.
  - `account`: This is where all the account management related files live.
  - `assets`: This is reserved for storing the project's assets.
  - `booking`: This is where you'll find booking related files.
  - `config`: This is where configuration related files are kept.
  - `core`: This is where the core settings of the Django project are.
  - `meta`: This is where metadata related files are kept.
  - `website`: This is where website related files are.
- `db.sqlite3`: This is the SQLite database file.
- `manage.py`: This is a command-line utility for interacting with the Django project.
- `requirements.txt`: This lists the Python dependencies for this project.
- `templates`: This is where HTML templates are stored.

To get started with the project, first, install the Python dependencies. Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, fire up the Django development server with:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You can then access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

Please note that this is just a basic overview of the project structure. I encourage you to explore each directory and file for a more comprehensive understanding of the project.

## Additional Instructions for the Bookinger Project

Here are some additional instructions on how to run tests, create a superuser for Django, and how to run and compile the client and frontend for the website and Android.

### Django Instructions

1. **Running Tests**: Django comes with a built-in test command. You can run it as follows:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

2. **Creating a Superuser**: To create a superuser for the Django admin interface, you can use the createsuperuser command:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You'll be prompted to enter a username, email address, and password.

### React Instructions

1. **Running the Client and Frontend**: Navigate to the respective directory (`client` or `frontend`) and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

2. **Building for the Website**: To create a production build of your React app for the website, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the compiled project. You can then serve it with a static server.

### React Native Instructions

1. **Running the Client on Android**: Make sure you have an Android emulator running, or a device connected, then run:

```bash
npm install
npx react-native run-android
```

2. **Building for Android**: To create a release build for Android, you can follow the [official React Native instructions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android).

Please note that these are basic instructions and you might need to adjust them based on your specific setup and requirements.

## Imaginative Idea for the Bookinger Project

Let's add a bit of imagination to the project. How about a feature called "Bookinger Virtual Tour"? This feature would allow users to take a virtual tour of the place they are planning to book. It could use augmented reality (AR) to provide a 360-degree view of the rooms, amenities, and surrounding areas. This would give users a more immersive experience and help them make informed decisions.

### To-Do List

Here's a potential to-do list for implementing the above idea and other tasks:

1. **Research AR Libraries**: Look into AR libraries that can be integrated with React Native for the mobile app.

2. **Design AR Interface**: Design the user interface for the AR feature. This includes the viewing screen, navigation buttons, and informational overlays.

3. **Implement AR Feature**: Write the code to implement the AR feature in the mobile app. This includes capturing and processing the AR data, rendering the AR view, and handling user interactions.

4. **Test AR Feature**: Thoroughly test the AR feature on various devices and under different conditions to ensure it works properly and provides a good user experience.

5. **Create Django Superuser**: Use the `createsuperuser` command to create a new superuser for the Django admin interface.

6. **Run Django Tests**: Use the `test` command to run all Django tests and ensure there are no regressions.

7. **Compile Website Client**: Use the `npm run build` command to compile the React client for the website.

8. **Compile Android Client**: Follow the official React Native instructions to create a release build for the Android client.
